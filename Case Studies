First Case Study Summary:
The data analysts wanted to use data to improve employee retention. In order to do that, they had to break this larger project into manageable tasks. The analysts organized those tasks and activities around the six phases of the data analysis process: 
1. Ask
2. Prepare
3. Process
4. Analyze
5. Share
6. Act

The analysts asked questions to define both the issue to be solved and what would equal a successful result. 

Next, they prepared by building a timeline and collecting data with employee surveys that were designed to be inclusive.

They processed the data by cleaning it to make sure it was complete, correct, relevant, and free of errors and outliers. 

They analyzed the clean employee survey data. Then the analysts shared their findings and recommendations with team leaders. Afterward, leadership acted on the results and focused on improving key areas.
